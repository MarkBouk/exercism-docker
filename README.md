# exercism-docker
 Dockerfiles for building docker images equipped with exercism and different programming languages for quickly jumping into exercism exercises.

To build an image for one of the language tracks, open a terminal in the folder for the desired track, e.g. Python

`docker build . -t python-exercism`

Or simply pull the image from my [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/markbouk)
